# Julia finite elements

This is a simple two-dimensional P1 finite element method implementation in Julia. Current features are very limited:

* Simple triangle refinement
* Assembly of bilinear forms
* Assembly of linear forms

Upcoming:

* Assembly of boundary (bi)linear forms

In a distant future:

* Other type of elements
* Three-dimensional solvers

## Info

The project is something I plan to advance during weekends.
My goal is to learn more about finite element solvers
and the underlying mathematics. Check also my blog
at http://derpsince.blogspot.fi for updates.
